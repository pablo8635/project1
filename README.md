# Hypothesis


# Description
Cardiovascular and high blood pressure diseases are among the leading causes of global mortality and is expected to rise over the next few decades, mainly due to aging. Eventhough a clear relation exists, other factors are also affecting growth rates. **The hypothesis states a relation between low socioeconomic level (income) and higher rates of diseases, supposing the population is less educated on health topics.**  PONER ALGO MAS AQUI

As the income gap between rich and poor widens, the importance of monitoring health disparities across the income spectrum rises, and the debated amount of appropriate government spending on health care makes income-related health inequality an even more relevant subject to study. 

This excercise is seeking to answer the following questions, clarifying the current trends and behaviours of this disases through the income spectrum from 2015 to 2018.
