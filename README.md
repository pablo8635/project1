# Hypothesis
People with high socioeconomic level get less diseases/illnesses related with sedentary life style and junk food consumption because they have more health education due to more opportunities and greater access to information. 

# Description
Cardiovascular and high blood pressure diseases are among the leading causes of global mortality and is expected to rise over the next few decades, mainly due to aging. Eventhough a clear relation exists, other factors are also affecting growth rates. **The hypothesis states a relation between low socioeconomic level (income) and higher rates of diseases, supposing the population is less educated on health topics.**  

The United Stes is one of the Top countries being consistently affected during the last years by both, aging and disparity of income between the extreme edges of the economically active population.

As the income gap between rich and poor widens, the importance of monitoring health disparities across the income spectrum rises, and the debated amount of appropriate government spending on health care makes income-related health inequality an even more relevant subject to study. 

This excercise is seeking to answer the following questions, clarifying the current trends and behaviours of this disases through the income spectrum from 2015 to 2018. 


# Variables and maps 
  - Income
  - Obesity %
  - Diabetes %
  - Heart attack diseases ratio
  - High blood pressure %
  - Cardiovascular death ratio
  
  
High blood pressure: Percetage of adults who reported bieng told by a health professional that they have high blood pressure.
Diabetes: Percentage of adults who reported being told by a health professional that they have diabetes (excluding prediabetes and gestional diabetes).
Cardiovascular deathts: Number of deaths due to all cardiovascular diseases including heart disease and stroke pre 100,000 population (3-year estimate age-adjusted to mid-year).
Hear attack: Percentage of adults who reported being told by a health professional that they had a heart attack (myocardial infarction).
Obesity: Percentage of adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher based on reportes height and weight.


# Questions
  1. What is the correlation between?
      - Income and all other variables
      - Heart attack and obesity
      - Heart attack and diabetes
      - 
  2. Which of the previously explained deseases has the biggest growth 	rate during the last years?
3. According to the analized data,income disparity among US popullation 	is generating poor people to become exposed to sicknesses?
  4. What conlusions can We infer about the median household income data?
  5. Do the data sets behave as normal distribution? If not, how should these datasets be analized?

# Tasks 
1. Define topic and formulate questions
2. Obtain data - obtain the data needed from available data sources.
3. Scrub data (organize and tidy) - clean, filter, consolidate, extract, replace, split, merge, extract data.
4. Explore data - compute desriptive statistics -.describe()- to test significant variables and extract singiciant features, EDA (exploratory data analysis) - insights and results.
5. Model data - reduce datasets dimensionalty, linear regressions, graphs,
6. Data interpretation

# Data Interpretation

Data sets shows mixed results, even when median household income has significantly increased, highblood pressure and cardiovascular deaths rate behaved stable in terms of total range and median

Heart attacks rate is also stable but shows a reduction of 1% in the data located in 4th quartile during the last two years.





Diabetes 

Obesity is by far the disease with the highest incremental rate not only by average of people affected but by showing data is located in the 3rd and 4rth quartile
